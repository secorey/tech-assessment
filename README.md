## Running the program

Install necessary Python packages:

```$ pip install requirements.txt```

The script for scraping the location data is found in [get_location_data.py](https://github.com/secorey/tech-assessment/blob/main/get_location_data.py). To get the data, run:

```$ python get_location_data.py```

This creates the file [location_data.csv](https://github.com/secorey/tech-assessment/blob/main/location_data.csv).

The script for generating plots can be found in [generate_plots.py](https://github.com/secorey/tech-assessment/blob/main/generate_plots.py), which creates visualizations in the [plots](https://github.com/secorey/tech-assessment/tree/main/plots) folder. To generate plots, run:

```$ python generate_plots.py```
